Assignment 2

This assignment uses Python 3 and ML Rose. Follow the instructions below to run code.

Note: Experiments take significant amount of time to run, mostly due to the MIMIC algorithm

Get code from github
https://github.com/srpatel625/cs7641-assignment2

1. pip install -r requirements.txt 
2. Run "python main.py -e fp" for Four Peaks problem
3. Run "python main.py -e cp" for Continuous Peaks problem
3. Run "python main.py -e om" for One Max problem
4. Run "jupyter notebook" for neural network backpropagation replacement problems (nn.ipynb). 
Then run each cell in sequential order
5. Run "jupyter notebook" to look at the notebooks for RO grid search (RO-Hyperparameter Tuning.ipynb)
